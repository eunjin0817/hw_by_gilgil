# Monkey Sapnner

## Introduction

When an incident occurs on a computer, it is important to understand how the malware was introduced. The analysis results of the inflow of malicious programs can be quickly identified due to a large number of open data, but many researchers are having difficulty finding data on the inflow of encroachment other than the scenario.

To solve these problems, I developed a tool that analyzes automatically artifacts in Windows and had been one of the outputs in the R&D project, [_Precise Analysis of an Attackerâ€™s Behavior using Offensive Research_](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Tv2MXWOoJNdj6tQUvM9kFX2TVhMWaQUe), which is supported by the Korea Information Technology Research Institute.

The tool, Monkey Spanner, performs an analysis based on a timeline and represents meaningful artifacts in different colors depending on their meaning so that a user, like a researcher, an incident response analyst, and so on, can figure out and track each case more easily. Also, it aims to be used as evidence to accurately analyze and categorize the behavior of attackers.

Meaningful artifacts were defined from prior research in this project. The research had been done by executing various 1-day exploit code and grouping the artifacts generated by each software.

At first, if significant artifacts were extracted, a prototype per software was created, and then the data structure and algorithm required were designed base on that.

During the study, the necessary materials had been pre-examined to prepare a 'development pre-survey report', which summarized the file format of each artifact and background knowledge for development in the GUI environment.

## Reference

I had used the following various open-source parser. Most of the parser had been written as python 2, so I modified to use it with python 3.
