# Intro

This repository saves the results performed in [Best of the Best 7th](https://www.kitribob.kr/learn/program), which is conducted by the Korea Information Technology Research Institute. At that time, I had taken 3 stages with information security.

The first stage was about the education of basic concepts. And the second stage was what students join a team and then carried out a project related to security. The third stage was about advanced practice.
